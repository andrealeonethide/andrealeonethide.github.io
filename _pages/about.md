Hello! I am a fourth year doctoral student in the Department of Communicative Sciences and Disorders at New York University. I work in the Psycholinguistics, Aphasia, and Neuromodulation (PLAN) Lab under the mentorship of Dr. Adam Buchwald. My research interests lie in speech motor learning, the application of neuromodulation in the rehabilitation of acquired communication disorders, and the use of neuroimaging methods to investigate how the brain processes language. I earned a Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology from Teacher's College, Columbia University and a Bachelor's of Science from James Madison University. 

Before beginning my doctoral studies, I worked as a clinician in the hospital setting and as an adjunct professor. You can contact me at alt10@nyu.edu. I'd love to hear from you!
