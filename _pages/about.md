Hello! I am a third year doctoral student in the Communicative Sciences and Disorders department at New York University. I work in the Psycholinguistics, Aphasia, and Neuromodulation (PLAN) Lab with Adam Buchwald. I earned a Master's degree in Speech-Language Pathology from Teacher's College, Columbia University and a Bachelor's of Science from James Madison University. My research interests lie in speech motor learning, language processing, acquired communication disorders, and neuromodulation. 

Prior to beginning my doctoral studies, I worked as a clinician in the hospital setting and as an adjunct professor. You can contact me at alt10@nyu.edu. I'd love to hear from you!
